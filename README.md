# Computer-Theory
Final Proyect

Project description
The Computer Theory project will be focused in the development of the following research question: to what extent generative AI tools could be used to provide valid Context-Free
Grammars production rules to assess the syntax of a snipped code from a selected programming language.

The produced system should be test according with one of the following expressions:
1. Arithmetic expressions
2. Control structures
3. Function definitions and calls
4. Assignment operations
5. Boolean expressions
6. Loop Structures
7. Array operations
8. String operations
9. Basic mathematical functions
10. Conditional expressions with ternary operator
    
The productions of each expressions could be found in the document “Production options” attached in the project folder.
